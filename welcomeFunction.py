Greetings, hero! We need your help slaying the almighty Python who has
commandeered the ATL Tech Village! Others have attempted in the past, and 
those who fled and survived have notified us that there are corrupted developers
who have been brainwashed and are guarding the Python. Should you defeat 
them, they will drop rubber duckies which will allow you to purchase a better
weapon at the barracks to aid you against the Python boss!
